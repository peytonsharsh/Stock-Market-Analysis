Data Bootcamp VBA homework - Peyton Harsh

the alphabet_testing_final_cleaned_up houses the same coding script as what is in the Multi_year_stock_data

the folder with alphabet_testing files shows previous versions and how I got to my solutions

Let me know if I need to submit anything else!

Thanks,
Peyton
